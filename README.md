# HeartDiseaseSVM
Support Vector Machine model to predict heart disease.

14 Attributes Used:
- Age: age in years
- Sex: sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
- CP: chest pain type (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
- TRestBPS: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to hospital)
- Chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- FBS: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- RestECG: resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
- MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved
- ExAng: exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- OldPeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
- CA: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- Thal: 3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect
- Diagnosis: diagnosis of heart disease (0 = <50% diameter narrowing, 1 = >50% diameter narrowing)
